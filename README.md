Work in progress

## Myo Predictor

Using the api myo-python (add link later) to train a recurrent neural network to predict hand gestures

Steps to acomplish my goal:
- [ ] Study courses on kaggle (intermediate machine learning and time series)
- [ ] Read the book Hands on ML[...] by Aurélien Géron
- [ ] Test examples of RNNs, CNNs and LSTMs
- [ ] Findout what are timesteps and how to use them as NNs inputs
